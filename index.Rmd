## Introduction

In recent years there has been an increasing pessimism about the prospect of 
owning a home, with younger generations dissatisfied how older generations
own homes while they cannot afford to. Younger generations may question whether
they will ever be able to own their own homes, and compare themselves to 
the seemingly far favorable conditions for older generations; indeed, home 
ownership and housing affordability is often cited as a core issue for
younger generations [1].

\
The goal of this project is to 
examine differences in home ownership between generations through home ownership rates by 
year, age, and locations. The proposed research question is: Have home ownership rates in 
the United States changed between the generations of Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, 
and Gen Z?

\
Answering this question is not as simple as comparing home ownership rates directly
between generations; as we might expect, generations that have been alive longer will
tend to have higher rates due to more time to gain wealth and more time in the housing
market. Instead, to better compare home ownership rates, we have to look at the trends
between generations of time, age, and geography to see if there are real differences.
Younger generations cite home ownership as a core issue, but to get a sense of
whether home ownership has truly declined, an analysis of the trends over age, 
time, and geography must be preformed. Conducting this analysis will provide
useful insight into the issue of home ownership between generations.

\
The dataset that was used to answer this question is a subset of the 
IPSUM CPS dataset. The dataset comes from the United States
Census Current Population Survey (CPS) and its supplemental Annual Social and 
Economic Supplement survey (ASEC). The CPS is preformed monthly to different
households in the US while the ASEC supplement is preformed annualy in March.
The dataset contains both household and individual level information, meaning
some variables refer to entire household information such as whether a house
is owned or rented, while other variables refer to individual information
such as a persons age.

\
As the entire IPUMS CPS dataset is large and contains many variables
that are irrelevant to this analysis, a subset of the data was used containing
only the variables and year range of interest described in the methods section.
